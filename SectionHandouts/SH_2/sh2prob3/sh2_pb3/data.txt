An Italian appeals court will announce its verdict on Thursday in the retrial of Seattle native Amanda Knox and her former Italian boyfriend who have been accused of killing a British student in 2007.

The verdict would be the latest development in a long-running legal saga for Ms. Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, who have both maintained their innocence in the murder of Meredith Kercher.

Ms. Knox, now 26 and studying creative writing at the University of Washington, declined to attend the retrial in Florence, saying she was afraid she wouldn’t get a fair trial. Neither she nor Mr. Sollecito, 29, was obliged to attend, but Mr. Sollecito made a few appearances in court.

“The prosecution has succeeded before in convincing a perfectly sound court…to convict innocent people,” Ms. Knox said in a letter to the court.
